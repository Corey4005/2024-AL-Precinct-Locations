# 2024-AL-Precinct-Locations

**Disclaimer:** This repository is not an official source of Alabama precinct information. Users should exercise discretion and refer to official data released by Alabama counties for accurate and up-to-date precinct details.

I'm collaborating with the [Alabama Progress Discord server](https://discord.gg/t7b5ryw5NG) on a political research project to provide statewide latitude and longitude coordinates for Alabama precincts. We're geocoding addresses sourced from each county and using the labels from the [2024 General Election Results - Precinct Level](https://www.sos.alabama.gov/alabama-votes/voter/election-data) dataset on the Alabama Secretary of State's website. The result is a set of spreadsheets containing precinct names, addresses, and their corresponding geographic coordinates.

Each output county spreadsheet includes:

Precinct name
Precinct address
Latitude and longitude coordinates

Volunteers from the Discord server have contributed to compiling data for many counties so far. The result is a growing set of spreadsheets that aim to improve accessibility and transparency around precinct locations in Alabama and to assist political researchers with useful datasets. If youâ€™d like to contribute to this project, please reach out to me in the Alabama Discord server: **@butterbeancw**.
